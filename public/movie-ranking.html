<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>
    Easily my faveourite film. The shots are stunning throughout, the emotions of the characters really carry the film and make it as beautiful as the sceanary. Great acting. Great music.

<h3>The Intern</h3>
<p>
    The best family freindly comedy I've seen. Amazing duo main cast that could probably carry any film their in. Simple, silly, perfectly cast, fun.

<h3>Logan</h3>
<p>
    Very dark for a super hero film. It was about super heores but it sure didn't feel like it. A great send off for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.
